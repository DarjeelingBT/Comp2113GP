Introduction

   You are a young man who want to build a career through your own hands. You want to start a business and set up a company by yourself. As the manager and operator of the company, you need to make all kinds of decisions carefully, know how to grasp opportunities  to develop the company into a world-class multinational company.


Rules of the game:

Pre setting:

     The basic rules of this game are similar to the combination of 《life reopening simulator》 and 《Reigns》. At the beginning of the game, you can edit the various attributes of the entrepreneur you control, including family background, connections, and luck. And three different types of companies, financial companies, technology companies and industrial companies.

     Players need to allocate limited points to three different attributes, and then choose a company type to start the game.


Game mainstream:

     In the game, various events occur in the form of text dialogue every day. Usually, players need to choose "reject" or "execute" to decide how to deal with this event. The game will continue indefinitely until a condition that will end the round is triggered. The purpose of players' play is to play a round of games as long as possible to develop their small start-up companies into large multinational companies in the world.


In game numerical value:

     In a round of game, there are three important values: integrity, connections and monthly profit. And an ultimate value: the company's total assets.

     Integrity is the most intuitive impression of the people on a company. If the company often has many negative events and don’t tell honestly, the people will avoid buying the company's products, which will directly lead to the decline of the company's profits.

     Connections refer to your ability to make friends, the number of people you know in the industry, etc. Good connections can give you a lot of opportunities, including investment, important core employees, etc.

     Monthly profit is the money the company earns every month, which may be positive or negative.

     Company's total assets is the most important value. There will be an initial asset at the beginning of the game. If the company's total assets become negative, the company will go bankrupt, and this round of the game will end immediately.


     These values are the core of the game, and you need to maintain the balance of these values. For example, choosing to exaggerate your products can improve your connections, but it will reduce your integrity; Developing new products will reduce monthly profits, but may increase your company's total assets in the future, etc.


Reincarnation of multi round games：

     This game encourages players to play in multiple rounds, In other words, you can't win without playing multiple rounds. In a round of game, if the total assets are negative, it will be game over and force the end of the round of game, but you will get a new talent, such as "communication master (increase your initial connection value)". These new talents can be used in your next round of game, making you more likely to win the game.
